Change Log
===========

[TODO]
--------
- switch c++ to float32 instead
- improve speed
- improve documentation
- configure circleci (+ test compilation on clang, gcc and msvc)
- easier building (get rid of the "make" part)
- distribute pypi package
- code helm powerflow method
- interface with gridpack (to enforce q limits for example)

[0.5.0] 2021-yy-xx
-------------------
- [FIXED] a compilation issue on macos
- [FIXED] a compilation issue on windows (missing import of vector in `DataConverter.h`)
- [FIXED] an import issue (with `lightsim2grid.SolverType`)
- [FIXED] a bug that lead to the wrong computation of the ratio of the trafo when the tap on hv side.
- [FIXED] wrong timing was measured in the "solver powerflow time" of pandapower in the benchmarks
- [FIXED] a broken handling of shunt modification (wrong bus was assigned)
- [FIXED] an issue in `LightSimBackend.copy` that prevent the copied environment from being reset.
- [FIXED] errors are now raised when pandapower grid cannot be converted in lightsim2grid (*eg.* when
  unsupported elements are present)
- [ADDED] a variant of the Gauss Seidel method which does the update in a "synchronous" fashion
- [ADDED] a function that, given a complex vector is able to check kicchoff's law violation.
- [ADDED] Support for phase shifter (modeled as trafo with an extra parameter `shift`)
- [ADDED] Experimental support for `sn_mva` pandapower parameter.
- [UPDATED] github issue template
- [IMPROVED] warnings are issued when some of the pandapowergrid attributes have been automatically replaced
  when converting to / from pandapower

[0.4.0] - 2020-10-26
---------------------
- [ADDED] the Gauss Seidel method for AC powerflow is now available
- [ADDED] possibility to change easily the solver types from python side

[0.3.0] - 2020-10-06
-------------------------
- [ADDED] Support for pickle for the lightsim Backend.
- [ADDED] LightSim should now be compatible with windows (implementation of a powerflow mode without
  using the SuiteSparse KLU linear solver but rather the Eigen SparseLU one)
- [ADDED] start of the documentation.

[0.2.4] - 2020-08-xx
--------------------
- [FIXED] issue for copying environment

[0.2.3] - 2020-08-03
--------------------
- [UPDATED] consistent behaviour between grid2op.PandaPowerBackend and LightSimBackend for action that
  set the bus of only one extremity of a powerline.
- [ADDED] compatibility with grid2op 1.2.0

[0.2.2] - 2020-06-25
---------------------
- [UPDATED] removing the `-march=native` that causes some difficulty for some compilers
- [ADDED] compatibility with grid2op 1.0.0

[0.2.1] - 2020-06-xx
--------------------
- [FIXED] update of the `topo_vect` attribute in class `LightSimBackend` when reset.
- [ADDED] a github issue template

[0.2.0] - 2020-06-15
--------------------
- [ADDED] the changelog
- [FIXED] the import of files when elements where not in service
- [FIXED] a bad catch of a divergence in the solver
- [IMPROVED] the speed to apply the actions
- [FIXED] tests for the backend in grid2op and here are not identical without (too much) duplicates
