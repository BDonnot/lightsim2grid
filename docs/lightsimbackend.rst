LightSimBackend
===================================
This is an implementation of a grid2op `Backend <https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backend.html>`_ that uses lightsim2grid simulator coded in c++.

The integration with grid2op is rather easy. You simply need to provide the key-word argument
`backend=LightSimBackend()` when building your environment using the `grid2op.make` function and you
can use it transparently.

Example
--------
See the section :ref:`use_with_g2op` for more information and more examples.

For standard grid2op environment, you can use it like:

.. code-block:: python

    import grid2op
    from lightsim2grid.LightSimBackend import LightSimBackend
    from grid2op.Agent import RandomAgent

    # create an environment
    env_name = "rte_case14_realistic"  # for example, other environments might be usable
    env = grid2op.make(env_name,
                       backend=LightSimBackend()  # this is the only change you have to make!
                       )

    # create an agent
    my_agent = RandomAgent(env.action_space)

    # proceed as you would any open ai gym loop
    nb_episode = 10
    for _ in range(nb_episde):
        # you perform in this case 10 different episodes
        obs = env.reset()
        reward = env.reward_range[0]
        done = False
        while not done:
            # here you loop on the time steps: at each step your agent receive an observation
            # takes an action
            # and the environment computes the next observation that will be used at the next step.
            act = agent.act(obs, reward, done)
            obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)
            # the `LightSimBackend` will be used to carry out the powerflow computation instead
            # of the default grid2op `PandaPowerBackend`
