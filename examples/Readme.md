## Description

- `security_anlysis` shows how to use the `SecurityAnalysis` module to simulate disconnections of powerline one after the other and benchmarks grid2op raw usage. It also check that that the results are the same when compared with grid2op.
- `time_serie` shows how to use the `TimeSerie` module efficiently and benchmarks this module compared to raw grid2op usage. It also check that that the results are the same when compared with grid2op.
